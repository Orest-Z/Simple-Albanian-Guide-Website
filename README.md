# Simple-Albanian-Guide-Website
This is a small project i had previously done at my college so i decided to publish it showcasing my basic skills in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

**Ignore below just some updates about bug fixing roadmap**

**NOTE**I have made my first deployment today but there is a small bug which i will be looking to solve. The autoplay video is not loading at all and i dont know why.

**QUICK UPDATE** It seems like ive gotten into another error, "No video with supported format and MIME type found" . The video i had uploaded was webm format now i converted it to mp4 i will try to see if that fixes the problem and this time i will turn off autoplay loop and muted , just leave video controls to see if it even shows up in the first place. 
**Now i tried to remove the folder videos completely in order to debug it and see if it works by just leaving the video in the main folder where index.html is located and see if it loads** I seem to have fixed the video loading bug now i have found another thing with the script of rezervo.html page where after fully completing the form it is not showing the correct thank you message it just resets the form again .
**LATEST UPDATE** I was able to fix the form application so that the user cannot select previous dates since it would not make sense. Also when he clicks the upload icon the page refreshes using the script and shows a thank you message for choosing our guides in Albanian. 
I hope you like it and feel free to contact me for further questions. \
