# Simple-Albanian-Guide-Website
This is a small project i had previously done at my college so i decided to publish it showcasing my basic skills in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

**NOTE**I have made my first deployment today but there is a small bug which i will be looking to solve. The autoplay video is not loading at all and i dont know why.
You can check it for yourself if you like with the following link: https://orest-z.github.io/Simple-Albanian-Guide-Website/index.html#

**QUICK UPDATE** It seems like ive gotten into another error, "No video with supported format and MIME type found" . The video i had uploaded was webm format now i converted it to mp4 i will try to see if that fixes the problem and this time i will turn off autoplay loop and muted , just leave video controls to see if it even shows up in the first place. 
**Now i tried to remove the folder videos completely in order to debug it and see if it works by just leaving the video in the main folder where index.html is located and see if it loads**
